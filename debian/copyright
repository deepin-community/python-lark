 Bootloader Exception
 --------------------
 .
 In addition to the permissions in the GNU General Public License, the
 authors give you unlimited permission to link or embed compiled bootloader
 and related files into combinations with other programs, and to distribute
 those combinations without any restriction coming from the use of those
 files. (The General Public License restrictions do apply in other respects;
 for example, they cover modification of the files, and distribution when
 not linked into a combined executable.)
 .
 Bootloader and Related Files
 ----------------------------
 .
 Bootloader and related files are files which are embedded within the
 final executable. This includes files in directories:
 .
 ./bootloader/
 ./PyInstaller/loader
 ./PyInstaller/hooks/rthooks
